# About this repo
 This is a repository for my paper to be presented at Politeknik APP Jakarta seminar. Green industry and logistics is the theme of that seminar. This, and the renewed Indonesia NDCs on climate and its brand now ETS (carbon market system) enacted in September 2023 piqued my interest to write about the Indonesian electricity sector.
