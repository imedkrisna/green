## Introduction

Some shit from @SEBK17 and @HDZ17 on calculation of cap n trade.

## Literature Review

The recent NDC and carbon market

The Indonesian electricity 

Some method people use

## Method

Let $Q$ be a quantity produced by the Indonesian economy which is nested with a leontief production function with energy. That is, $Q=\min (F(.),G(\omega))$, where $F$ is a combination of factors such as capital and labour. Let $\Omega$ be the total energy required to produce $Q$ in one period. The economy produces $\omega$ with a fully substitute sources:

$$
\omega=w_a+w_b+w_g
$$

where $w_a$ is the amount of clean energy used, while $w_b$ and $w_g$ are coal and gas respectively. if $p$ is a vector of prices of the three sources of energy and $w \in \{w_a,w_b,w_g\}$, producers in the economy are faced with a cost minimization problem to produce $Q$, and by extension, $\omega$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w} \ &  p \cdot w \\
\mbox{subject to } \ & \omega=w_a+w_b+w_g
\end{aligned}
$$

In this setting, $\omega$ is taken as exogenous as the consequence of the Leontief production nest. That is, factor of production is the driver of $Q$ and consequently $\omega$. This assumption allows the use of the cost minimization technique and observe the cost impact of idiosyncratic shock to prices.

We improve this setting by adding emission constraints. We limit total emission coming from the use of each source of energy. Next, we limit how much the total combination of emissions from these sources is allowed. This variable, then, can be set exogenously to reflect the government's preference of emission.

Let $a,b,g$ be parameters which reflect emission generated per megawatt hour by $w_a, w_b, w_g$ respectively. Let $\varepsilon$ be the total emission generated by the Indonesian electricity sector, Then the total emission generated by these sources is:

$$
aw_a+bw_b+gw_g=\varepsilon
$$

With the above emission constraint, we have a complete linear system as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{W} \ &  p \cdot w \\
\mbox{subject to } \ & w_a+ w_b+ w_G \ge \omega \\
 & aw_a+bw_b+gw_g \le \varepsilon \\
 & w_a,w_b,w_g \ge 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

The shock of the model can come from two exogenous variables $p$ which reflects a carbon tax, or $\varepsilon$ which reflects how much carbon quota is given in the economy as a whole.

The next step is to find a representative parameter. @pln is the main source of $\omega$ and $p \cdot w$. Perusahaan Listrk Negara (PLN) statistics is reliable since it is the sole distributor of electricity in Indonesia. According to @pln, Indonesia generates 279,511.24 Gigawatt hour (GWh) in 2021. From those, around 60% are produced using coal as its main source and around 23% by some mixes of fossil fuels. Only 17% is generated by renewables, mostly hydroelectric [@ember;@pln].

@pln also contains data on prices per Kilowatt hour of electricity based on sources. Total emission generated by the electricity sector is calculated based on the emission factor and how much energy source is used by the sector. Lastly, emission factor $a,b,g$ are calibrated from @febijanto10 and @jrc. The number of emission factor varies between countries and in different reports, and emission factor in this paper tries to balance those differences[^1].

## Results and discussions

### Perfect substitution

The linear setting in the previous section is trivial enough to be solved by linear programming method in Scipy [@quant]. Four different cases are considered in this paper.

| case | description | model setting |
| --- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 1 | status quo | current share of energy use |
| 2 | current emission, optimized | current total emission, optimized |
| 3 | carbon tax | current share but carbon is taxed |
| 4 | long-run with aggresive target | like case 2 but with emission reduced by 27% |
| 5 | long-run with renewable constraint | case 4 with renewable contraint |

class carbon:
  r"""
  implements the perfect substition of energy usage with prices and emission as the contraints. Note: the default emission is calculated by share of electricity generated times its emission factor.
  
  the cd() function, meawhile, proposes a cobb-douglass function for electricity generation. However, it hasn't been showing a good iteration regarding the parameterisation. More data is needed to make better calibrations.
