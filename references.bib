   abstract = {This paper investigates the optimal production decisions of a self-pricing manufacturer and the optimal cap-setting decisions of a regulator under the cap-and-trade regulation. The objectives of the manufacturer and the regulator are to maximize profit and to maximize social welfare, respectively. We first derive the optimal production decisions and the corresponding total emissions of the manufacturer, with given parameters of the cap-and-trade regulation. Based on these results, we then solve the optimal cap-setting problem of the regulator. Furthermore, through sensitive analyses, we show that as the emissions intensity (i.e., the emissions generated from one unit of product) increases, both the optimal total emissions and the optimal cap first increase and then decrease.},

   abstract = {This study analytically examines the effects on profitability of using an emissions cap-and-trade policy. A game-theoretic Cournot model with two competitive firms producing goods, along with undesirable emissions, for a single market is investigated. Production costs are non-linear and product demand is price-sensitive. First, relationships are derived to maximize each firm's profit under a given emissions permit price and given emissions constraints, or caps. Production volumes for each firm at the equilibrium are determined with and without the assumption that emissions permit trading can occur. Relationships are then developed to investigate behavior as a function of emissions caps, the allocation of caps between firms, and the emissions permit price. Bounds on the ranges within which permit trading will occur are also determined. Results show the conditions under which profits rise or fall as emissions constraints are tightened. The conditions under which firms benefit equally from emissions permit trading are also developed. Finally, the analysis shows that the firm with the lower emissions intensity will never purchase emissions permits if its operational costs are higher than those of the competitor. Therefore, cap-and-trade will not necessarily provide an incentive for the firm with the lowest emissions intensity to increase its market share.},

	abstract = {The methodology of calculation for emission factor for grid connection is determined by IPCCC Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change). The methodology is revised periodically,and become comprehensive calculation. Mainly in developed countries, the emission factor is provided by government related institution yearly. Therefore the developers who need that value can get easily, and they can save a time and money in the developing Clean Development Mechanism Project. In Indonesia, until now there is no government institution or other related institutions that have an obligation to provide and calculate that number.PTPSE-BPPT has initiated to calculate the emission factor of grid system of Jawa-Madura-Bali using data between 2002 and 2006. The Approved Consolidated Methodology 0002 and Approved Methodology Simple I-D were used in the calculation. Based on the calculationresult, it was proved that the emission factor of JAMALI grid increased 18.2%, resulted to coal consumption increased. The value of this emission factor has been adopted by Directorate General Electricity and energy Utilization and recognized by Indonesian Designated National Authority, as a National Number of emission factor in JAMALI in 2008.},

abstract = {Solar and wind electricity generation technologies have become cost competitive and account for a growing share of global investment in new electricity generation capacity. Both India and Indonesia have ambitious targets for adoption of these technologies, and India has an impressive current rate of uptake. Substantial obstacles exist, however, including the entrenched positions of coal and other fossil fuels, regulatory barriers to market access, and weak abilities of electricity utilities to manage intermittent renewables. This paper reviews these obstacles and discusses strategies to overcome them. We focus on the use of reverse auction processes able to deliver low-price solar and wind contracts, as are being successfully employed in India, on tax and subsidy reform options, on regulatory and incentive-design strategies, on approaches to bolster grid management capacities, and on the importance of minimizing protectionist barriers. Our analysis covers both small-scale and large-scale systems.}

abstract = {Indonesia's budget has for years been burdened by large subsidies for electricity consumption. A series of recent reforms has delivered a substantial reduction in these subsidies. In this paper we estimate demand-side effects of these reforms on electricity use. Our analysis utilizes a three-dimensional dataset covering six consumer groups, 16 regions, and 1992â€“2015. We control for various fixed effects, and use an instrumental variable approach. Our estimates suggest that subsidy reductions since 2013 had induced savings in annual electricity use of around 7% relative to the no-reform counterfactual as of 2015. The phase-out of remaining subsidies has the potential to generate further improvements in the efficiency of electricity use, while freeing up resources for other priorities such as infrastructure spending.}
