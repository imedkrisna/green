   abstract = {This paper investigates the optimal production decisions of a self-pricing manufacturer and the optimal cap-setting decisions of a regulator under the cap-and-trade regulation. The objectives of the manufacturer and the regulator are to maximize profit and to maximize social welfare, respectively. We first derive the optimal production decisions and the corresponding total emissions of the manufacturer, with given parameters of the cap-and-trade regulation. Based on these results, we then solve the optimal cap-setting problem of the regulator. Furthermore, through sensitive analyses, we show that as the emissions intensity (i.e., the emissions generated from one unit of product) increases, both the optimal total emissions and the optimal cap first increase and then decrease.},

   title = {Modeling competitive firms' performance under price-sensitive demand and cap-and-trade emissions constraints},

   abstract = {This study analytically examines the effects on profitability of using an emissions cap-and-trade policy. A game-theoretic Cournot model with two competitive firms producing goods, along with undesirable emissions, for a single market is investigated. Production costs are non-linear and product demand is price-sensitive. First, relationships are derived to maximize each firm's profit under a given emissions permit price and given emissions constraints, or caps. Production volumes for each firm at the equilibrium are determined with and without the assumption that emissions permit trading can occur. Relationships are then developed to investigate behavior as a function of emissions caps, the allocation of caps between firms, and the emissions permit price. Bounds on the ranges within which permit trading will occur are also determined. Results show the conditions under which profits rise or fall as emissions constraints are tightened. The conditions under which firms benefit equally from emissions permit trading are also developed. Finally, the analysis shows that the firm with the lower emissions intensity will never purchase emissions permits if its operational costs are higher than those of the competitor. Therefore, cap-and-trade will not necessarily provide an incentive for the firm with the lowest emissions intensity to increase its market share.},
